title: Media Block
modifiers: --small
---

The media block is based on Nicole Sullivan's popular [media object](http://www.stubbornella.org/content/2010/06/25/the-media-object-saves-hundreds-of-lines-of-code/) pattern. It contains a media element — typically an image — on the left with a headline and text on the right. It is a versatile pattern that contain content such as blog posts, user information, and other content types.

The media block pattern also has a `--small` modifier that decreases the size of the image and text.
